# Rebuild status log

Append-only. One entry per start, checkpoint, half hour of work, and end. Heading
`## <date> — <agent> — <task>`; then **Working on**, **Measured**, **Decisions made**,
**Questions asked**. Keep it short: the next agent reads this first.

## 2026-09-25 — orchestrator (Fable) — wave 1 launched
**Working on:** Kobin's decisions recorded in `PLAN.md` §0; the cloud preamble; the agent
definitions (`.claude/agents/opus-analyst.md`, `opus-builder.md`, `opus-reviewer.md`, copies under
`review/rebuild/agents/`); analyses A1 (document model), A2 (scene + generation + erase rule) and
A3 (pyramid + rest render + queue + Dev levers + MovePlane port + SVG demotion) launched read-only.
**Measured:** the baseline from `review/RENDERER-REBUILD-2026-09-25.md` §6 (typecheck 0, lint 0,
quick suite 2,061/2,062 on Node 14, the headless harness round trip pixel-identical).
**Decisions made:** the erase rule takes targets-at-pen-up plus `handledBy` (Kobin's drag-across
semantics); MovePlane stays with five layers and the pre-render; selection stays frame-based and the
container/lattice untangling is its own step.
**Questions asked:** none open.

## 2026-09-25 — A1 (analyst) — the document model: container and lattice untangled — start
**Working on:** reading the brief's documents (PLAN §0.9/§1.7, DESIGN §1–3/8/10/13, the frame-lattice
bible §10 first, SUBTREE-O1-PLAN, EARTH-MOVE-ANALYSIS, the three reviews' named sections), then the
code inventory. Read-only; the only files I write are `review/rebuild/A1-document-model.md` and my
entries here.
**Measured:** nothing yet.
**Decisions made:** none yet.
**Questions asked:** none yet.

## 2026-09-25 — A3 (analyst) — the pyramid, rest render, partial re-render, queue, Dev levers, MovePlane port, SVG demotion — start
**Working on:** reading the brief's documents (PLAN §1.2/§1.4–§1.6, DESIGN §9, PAPER-PLAN §3/§7/§9/§10,
RASTERISER-PLAN §2.7/§6, the three reviews' named sections, RENDERER-REBUILD §3.3/§3.7/§4.4/§6), then the
raster code inventory. Read-only; the only files I write are `review/rebuild/A3-pyramid.md` and my entries
here. I will read `review/rebuild/A2-scene.md` when it exists for the scene/tile-budget interface.
**Measured:** nothing yet.
**Decisions made:** none yet.
**Questions asked:** none yet.

## 2026-09-25 23:25 UTC — A2 (analyst) — the scene, the generation model, the erase rule — start
**Working on:** reading the preamble, PLAN (all), DESIGN §7–§10, the three reviews' named sections and
the rebuild analysis §2/§3.2/§3.5/§4, then the code (KobinEngine list/render/plates, TileStore,
Document events and step graph, the erase pipeline and worker, the raster pack/core/renderer,
selection, overlays, offsets, the oplog/files/persist format). Read-only; the only files I write are
`review/rebuild/A2-scene.md` and my entries here.
**Measured:** nothing yet.
**Decisions made:** none yet.
**Questions asked:** none yet.
